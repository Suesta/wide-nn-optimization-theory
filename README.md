## 🧠 Abstract

This work investigates the optimization landscape of wide neural networks using tools from functional analysis, linearization theory, and the neural tangent kernel (NTK).  
The thesis provides theoretical insights into the convergence dynamics of gradient descent in the infinite-width limit, supported by formal derivations and illustrative examples.

Main contributions include:
- Rigorous derivation of NTK-based dynamics in the functional regime  
- Formal control of the linearization error and Hessian approximation  
- Discussion of generalization via implicit regularization mechanisms  
- Interpretation of optimization trajectories in terms of curvature and low-loss paths
